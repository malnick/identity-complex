Identity Complex is a blog exploring authentication, identity, and the boundaries of autonomous systems.

As AI agents become more prevalent and capable, the systems we build to secure them must evolve. This space examines the hard problems at the intersection of security, identity, and artificial intelligence—from cryptographic foundations to the philosophical questions about what it means for a non-human actor to have an identity.

## Topics

- **Agent Authentication** — How do we build identity systems for AI agents that treat them as accountable principals rather than extensions of human actors?

- **Workload Identity** — Modern approaches to machine-to-machine authentication in distributed systems, including SPIFFE, WIMSE, and verifiable credentials.

- **Security Architecture** — Designing security models that work for systems with non-deterministic behavior and adaptive decision-making.

- **Identity Standards** — Tracking developments in IETF, W3C, and other bodies working on the future of digital identity.

## The Author

I write about the hard problems in identity and security for autonomous systems. My work focuses on building authentication infrastructure that can adapt to a world where humans and AI agents operate as co-equal principals.
